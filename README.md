# Cytology


Code associated with the paper "Anomaly Detection Applied to the Classification of Cytology Images".

The repository contains two folders:
- ImageJ macros: contains the code to run the proposed pipeline in ImageJ.
- AnomalyDetectionCode: contains the code to train the anomaly detection models and use them for inference.

In addition, we provide a [pip package](https://github.com/joheras/CitologyAnomalyDetector/tree/main) to easily run the anomaly detection models. This package must be installed before using the ImageJ macros. 

We also provide a [virtual machine](https://unirioja-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ancasag_unirioja_es/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fancasag%5Funirioja%5Fes%2FDocuments%2FJonathan&ga=1) where everything is installed and ready to use. In order to run the virtual machine, [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) should be installed in the computer.
